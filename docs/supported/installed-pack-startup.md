## Installed pack startup

- Packs may own exact node IDs with case, spaces and dots, without renaming
  them. Namespace and exact-node ownership reject overlapping owners through
  install, composition and reload. Pack and publisher identities remain
  lowercase with equivalent separator spellings.
- Locale catalogs preserve exact node and port IDs, including spaces, case,
  wildcard outputs and trailing dots. Node translations must belong to the pack.
- The native text, primitive, eager boolean, number conversion, seed and math
  expression nodes load through their ordinary pack manifest, including isolated
  execution, reload and exact-ID ownership checks.
- Installed pack schemas and static choices are available before pack workers
  start. Workers activate on demand, including in-process packs and explicitly
  configured shared-process groups.
- Pack install, update, and doctor refresh the persisted schema catalog.
  Serving fails before binding when an installed catalog is missing or stale.
- The default local launcher prepares missing or stale catalogs before binding,
  then serves the browser application and engine API from one loopback origin.
- Health reports composed and failed counts and is not ready when composition
  is empty or any pack failed.
